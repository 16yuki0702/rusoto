//! <p><p> Service Quotas is a web service that you can use to manage many of your AWS service quotas. Quotas, also referred to as limits, are the maximum values for a resource, item, or operation. This guide provide descriptions of the Service Quotas actions that you can call from an API. For the Service Quotas user guide, which explains how to use Service Quotas from the console, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/intro.html">What is Service Quotas</a>. </p> <note> <p>AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc...,). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to Service Quotas and AWS. For information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws.amazon.com/tools">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a> page.</p> </note></p>

//! If you're using the service, you're probably looking for [ServiceQuotasClient](struct.ServiceQuotasClient.html) and [ServiceQuotas](trait.ServiceQuotas.html).
