//! <p>Welcome to the AWS Ground Station API Reference. AWS Ground Station is a fully managed service that
//! enables you to control satellite communications, downlink and process satellite data, and
//! scale your satellite operations efficiently and cost-effectively without having
//! to build or manage your own ground station infrastructure.</p>
//!
//! If you're using the service, you're probably looking for [GroundStationClient](struct.GroundStationClient.html) and [GroundStation](trait.GroundStation.html).
